# Rock-Paper-Scissors
exercise on functions, if-else statement, switch statement

A classic two player hand game dating back to ancient China.

Here are its universal rules:

Rock destroys scissors
Scissors cut paper
Paper covers rock
Keeping these guidelines in mind, weâ€™ll create a rock, paper, scissors program but with a modern twist - one of the players is a computer!

Our program will consist of 3 functions and utilize previously covered Swift concepts including if/else and switch statements to determine the winner amongst 2 players.


After few attempts and errors, I finally able to write out the code all by myself with little help from the instructions.
